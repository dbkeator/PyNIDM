"""
nidm.linkml.experiment — RDFLib + LinkML implementation of NIDM-Experiment.

Mirrors the public API of the legacy ``nidm.experiment`` package
(Project, Session, Acquisition, AcquisitionObject, MRAcquisition,
MRObject, PETAcquisition, PETObject, AssessmentAcquisition,
AssessmentObject, DemographicsObject, DataElement, PersonalDataElement,
Derivative, DerivativeObject) but built on ``rdflib.Graph`` directly,
backed by Pydantic dataclasses generated from ``nidm_schema.yaml``.

Wrappers are landing incrementally — re-exports below grow as each
class is ported.
