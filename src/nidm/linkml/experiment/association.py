"""
Association -- the prov:Association connecting an Activity to an
Agent with a specific role.

In NIDM-Experiment, Associations link Acquisitions (or Derivatives)
to research participants (``prov:agent -> Person``) with a
qualifying role (``prov:hadRole``, typically ``sio:Subject``).  Per
the schema's documentation, Associations are emitted as **blank
nodes** in the graph by default -- callers may override by passing
``identifier=URIRef(...)`` if a named association is needed.

Typical usage is via ``Acquisition.add_qualified_association(person,
role=...)``, which constructs an Association and emits the
``prov:qualifiedAssociation`` triple from the Acquisition to the
new Association in one step.
