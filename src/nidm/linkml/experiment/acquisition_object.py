"""
AcquisitionObject -- the data entity produced by an Acquisition.

Carries the actual measurement / acquisition payload: imaging
modality, contrast type, intended usage, filename, hash, file
location, plus assessment / demographics values stored as extra
properties on the object (those land via DataElement-URI-keyed
properties, which we support once DataElement is wrapped in a later
chunk).

The link back to the parent Acquisition is via
``prov:wasGeneratedBy``.  Enum fields (acquisition_modality,
image_contrast_type, image_usage_type) automatically resolve to their
``meaning:`` URIs via the LinkMLBackedNode base.
