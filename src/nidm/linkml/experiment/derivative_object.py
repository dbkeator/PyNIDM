DerivativeObject -- an entity produced by a Derivative processing
activity, containing the actual derived measurements.

Similar to ``AcquisitionObject``, derived measurement values are
stored as properties on the DerivativeObject using DataElement URIs
as predicates with literal values (the "DataElement URIs as
predicates" pattern documented on the DataElement schema class).

Constructor takes a parent Derivative for graph-sharing and linkage:
``prov:wasGeneratedBy`` from this DerivativeObject to the Derivative.
