"""
Public API for ingesting brain-segmentation derivatives into NIDM.

This module is the single source of truth that the FSL / FreeSurfer /
ANTs "*_seg_to_nidm" ingester repositories call so their derivative
modeling stays byte-for-byte consistent with ``csv2nidm -derivative``.

The one public entry point, :func:`add_segmentation_derivative`, emits a
``nidm:Derivative`` activity + ``nidm:DerivativeObject`` (additionally
typed ``nidm:DerivativeCollection``) carrying the segmentation measures,
a ``nidm:SoftwareAgent`` describing the producing tool, and a subject
``prov:Person`` linked by a ``prov:qualifiedAssociation`` with role
``sio:Subject``.  The exact modeling is delegated to the SAME helpers
csv2nidm uses (imported below), so there is no divergence between the two
code paths.

Two modes:

* ``nidm_file`` given -> load that experiment NIDM file, find the
  existing ``prov:Person`` for ``subject_id`` (matched on
  ``ndar:src_subject_id``, leading-zero tolerant), attach the derivative
  to it, and return the merged graph.
* ``nidm_file`` None  -> build a STANDALONE graph: a minimal
  ``nidm:Project`` + a ``prov:Person`` carrying
  ``ndar:src_subject_id == subject_id`` + the derivative.  Loaded
  alongside an experiment TTL in a triplestore, this graph cross-joins to
  the subject on ``ndar:src_subject_id`` (see
  ``nidm.linkml.experiment.query.GetBrainVolumes``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    subject_id
        Study subject identifier (``ndar:src_subject_id``).  Matched
        leading-zero tolerant against an existing experiment graph.
    software_metadata
        Dict describing the producing tool.  Keys: ``title``,
        ``description``, ``version``, ``url``, ``cmdline``, ``platform``.
    measures
        ``{cde_variable_name: value}`` -- the segmentation volumes.  Each
        key must match an ``nidm:sourceVariable`` literal in *cde*.
    cde
        ``rdflib.Graph`` of CDE definitions (fs/fsl/ants) for the
        measures.  Merged into the output so the DataElement metadata
        (label, measureOf, datumType) travels with the values.
    nidm_file
        Existing NIDM experiment file to append to.  ``None`` builds a
        standalone graph.
    source_url
        Optional source URL recorded as ``prov:Location`` on the
        derivative object.
    output_file
        When given, the resulting graph is serialized to this path as
        turtle.
    merge_cde
        When ``True`` (default) the *cde* definition triples are merged
        into the returned graph so the DataElement metadata travels with
        the values (self-contained, GetBrainVolumes-queryable from one
        file).  When ``False`` the *cde* is used only to resolve each
        measure's predicate URI and is NOT merged -- the caller is
        expected to serialize the CDE separately (e.g. a shared
        ``*_cde.ttl`` imported alongside the derivative in a triplestore).
        The measure values still use the CDE URIs as predicates either
        way, so a query works once both graphs are loaded.

    Returns
    -------
    rdflib.Graph
        The merged / standalone graph containing the derivative.

    Notes
    -----
    * ``nidm_file`` given  -> load it, find the existing Person by
      ``subject_id`` (``ndar:src_subject_id``, leading-zero tolerant),
      attach the derivative to it, return the merged graph.
    * ``nidm_file`` None   -> build a STANDALONE graph: a minimal Project +
      a Person carrying ``ndar:src_subject_id == subject_id`` + the
      derivative.  Loaded alongside an experiment TTL, it joins to that
      subject on ``ndar:src_subject_id`` (see
