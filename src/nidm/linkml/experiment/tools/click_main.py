"""Aggregator for the LinkML ``pynidm`` CLI.

Importing each tool module runs its ``@cli.command()`` registration as a
side effect, so by the time :data:`cli` is exposed every subcommand is
attached.  This mirrors ``nidm.experiment.tools.click_main`` and is the
entry point the ``pynidm`` console_script points at after cutover.

Subcommands are added here as each legacy tool is ported to the LinkML
toolset (task 8).
