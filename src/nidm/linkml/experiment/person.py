Person -- a research participant / subject.

A Person is a ``prov:Agent`` carrying the participant's
``ndar:src_subject_id`` (e.g. ``"sub-01"``, ``"sub-0050002"``).  In
NIDM, Persons are linked to Acquisition activities via the
``prov:qualifiedAssociation`` -> ``prov:Association`` ->
``prov:agent`` chain (the Association wrapper lands in a later
chunk; once it is available, ``Acquisition.add_qualified_association
(person, role=...)`` will be the canonical way to wire participants
to acquisitions).

Persons share the Project's graph for graph-locality but are not a
Project containment field in the schema -- they live as top-level
agents in the graph.
